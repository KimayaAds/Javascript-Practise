<h2>Javascript Strings</h2>
<p>You can break a code line within a text string with a backslash</p>
<p>For best readabiltity programmmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters
<br>
if a javascript  statement doesnot fit on one line the best place is to break it after an  operator
